# SiteSort – Claude Code Guide

## Project

SiteSort is a full-stack construction site information management platform for SME construction companies. Built as a pnpm monorepo with TypeScript throughout.

## Stack

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces
- **API**: Express 5, Node 24, TypeScript 5.9
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod (v4), drizzle-zod
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite, React Query, react-hook-form, Recharts
- **Build**: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Repo Structure

```
artifacts/
  api-server/       # Express API (port 8080, served at /api)
  sitesort/         # React + Vite frontend (port 18299, served at /)
lib/
  api-spec/         # OpenAPI spec + Orval codegen config
  api-client-react/ # Generated React Query hooks
  api-zod/          # Generated Zod schemas
  db/               # Drizzle ORM schema + DB connection
scripts/
  src/
    github-setup.ts # Creates the GitHub repo via Replit Connectors
    github-push.ts  # Pushes workspace files to GitHub via GitHub API
```

## Key Commands

```bash
pnpm run typecheck                              # Typecheck from root
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen  # Regenerate API client + Zod schemas
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push           # Push DB schema changes
```

## Pushing to GitHub

There is no git remote pointing to GitHub. Pushes are done via the Replit Connectors SDK:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/src/github-push.ts
```

This uses the authenticated GitHub connector (no token needed) to push all workspace files to `deanparrish-cmd/sitesort` via the GitHub Contents API.

To create the repo fresh:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/src/github-setup.ts
```

## Auth

JWT tokens, stored as `sitesort_token` in localStorage. Header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Demo credentials: `paul@acme.com` / `password123` (company: Acme Construction)

## Features Built

1. Version-controlled document hub (auto versioning, SUPERSEDED badges)
2. Targeted team distribution (track pending/viewed/acknowledged)
3. Digital sign-off tracking (PIN confirmation, timestamped)
4. Real-time in-app notifications (bell with live unread count)
5. Compliance photo log (timestamped, GPS metadata, reference numbers)
6. Subcontractor insurance monitor (valid/expiring_soon/expired)
7. QR code site board integration
8. Permit management (active/expiring/expired, responsible persons, certificate file attachment, Open Certificate button)
9. Compliance center (aggregate view across projects, drag-and-drop certificate upload)
10. Team management (admin/project_manager/site_worker/subcontractor roles)
11. Subcontractor cards — call/email/SMS/WhatsApp action buttons, visible contact details, trade badges, notes field
12. Add subcontractors from company directory into individual projects
13. Full compliance page (was placeholder) — expiring insurance/permits, pending sign-offs, drag-and-drop file upload
14. Full team page (was placeholder) — members grouped by role, last-active
15. Team messaging — direct messages between team members, two-panel chat UI, 5s polling, unread badges
16. Message notifications — toast + browser OS notification on new message, live badge on sidebar Messages item and bell icon, manager "View All" read-only oversight mode
17. Notifications page (`/notifications`) — filter tabs (All/Unread/Messages/Documents/Safety), per-type icons, click-to-read, mark-all-read, badge clears on visit, navigates to related entity on click
18. Invoice file attachments — drag-and-drop or click-to-upload per invoice row, `attachmentUrl` column on invoices table, Open/Email/WhatsApp share dropdown, remove button
19. Document & certificate sharing — Open + Email/WhatsApp share on project documents tab and compliance insurance certificate rows; compliance API extended to include `certificateUrl`
20. Settings page (`/settings`) — Profile (name/phone/avatar upload), Security (change password), Notifications (toast + OS toggles in localStorage), Company (admin: name/size); API: `PATCH /auth/me`, `POST /auth/change-password`, `GET/PATCH /companies/mine`
21. Document supersedes selector — upload form shows optional dropdown of current docs of the same type; selecting one marks it superseded on save; API accepts explicit `supersededDocumentId` with same-name auto-supersede fallback
22. Document status/version editing — Edit button on document rows opens dialog to change status (current/superseded) and version number; `PATCH /api/documents/:documentId`
23. Subscription billing — Stripe Checkout (Solo £29/Team £79/Pro £149, 14-day trial), webhook sync, Customer Portal, plan-based project limits, trial-ending and payment-failed notifications
24. Read-only mode on cancellation — persistent red banner on all authenticated pages; all write actions across every page show a destructive toast and return early when cancelled; settings profile/password/company show inline error banner; `SubscriptionContext` exposes `isCancelled` app-wide
25. Real user dashboard — personalised greeting, quick-action buttons, 4-stat cards (active projects/expiring items/pending sign-offs/unread messages), "Needs Attention" panel, recent activity feed, portfolio snapshot, site calendar
26. Invoice document viewer — full-screen inline viewer panel; PDF via file card (Open PDF button + Download link), image via `<img>`; sidebar with invoice details; header actions: `window.open()` open, share, mark paid
27. Project detail report / PDF export — "Export Report" button generates a print-ready HTML report (team, permits, documents, finances, photos) and auto-triggers browser Save-as-PDF
28. Subcontractor "Add to Project" — FolderPlus button on each sub card opens a dialog listing active projects; one-click add with inline per-project feedback (added/already linked/error)
29. Enforced subcontractor directory-first workflow — removed "Add Person" form and dialog from the project Team tab; contacts must be added to the subcontractor directory first, then linked into a project via "Add from Subcontractor Directory"
30. Broadcast messaging — "New" button in Messages opens a three-mode picker: Individual (1-to-1), By Role (filter project members by Admin/PM/Site Worker/Subcontractor), All in Project; backend `POST /api/messages/broadcast` sends message + notification per recipient
31. Landing page pricing section — "Start Free Trial" smooth-scrolls to Solo £29/Team £79/Pro £149 plan cards; Book Demo button removed
32. Invoice sharing in messages — Receipt button in compose bar opens an invoice picker; selected invoice renders as a card in the thread (counterparty, amount, status badge, due date, PDF link); `invoiceId` nullable column on messages table; `content` defaults to `""` to allow invoice-only messages
33. Document, photo, and permit sharing in messages — Paperclip button in compose bar opens a tabbed picker (Document / Photo / Permit) with a project selector; selected item shown as a violet chip; thread renders typed cards: document (name, type, version, view link), photo (thumbnail, category, reference), permit (type, description, expiry status badge); `attachmentType` + `attachmentId` columns on messages table; API thread endpoint batch-fetches attachment data
34. Project channel group messaging — each active project gets a shared `#channel` thread visible to all project members; appears above DMs in sidebar with blue `#` icon and unread badge; full attachment support (doc/photo/permit cards); sender name + role chip on every message; edit/delete own messages; 5s polling; notifications to all project members on send; `channel_messages` + `channel_reads` tables; `GET/POST /api/channels/:projectId/messages`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/channel-messages/:id`
35. Message enhancements — emoji reactions (👍 ✅ 👀 ❤️ 😂) on DMs and channels (hover picker, pill badges, toggle); reply-to-message WhatsApp-style quote bubbles; debounced sidebar message search across DMs and channels with yellow-highlighted snippets; 18 quick reply templates in 4 site-specific categories via ⚡ Zap button
36. Subcontractor invite links — UserPlus button on each sub card generates a unique invite link; share modal with copy, WhatsApp/Email/SMS options; register page detects `?invite=<token>` and shows tailored join form (email locked, name pre-filled, password only); backend creates user with `subcontractor` role and marks invite as used
37. Beta access flag — `betaAccess` boolean on `companies` table; companies with `beta_access=true` bypass all Stripe subscription checks (`isCancelled` always false, effective status always "active"); set via `UPDATE companies SET beta_access=true WHERE name='...'`
38. Project progress tracking — `milestones` table (title, dueDate, completedAt, order; cascade-delete with project); 4 CRUD endpoints; `progressPercent` on list and detail now computed from completed/total milestones; "Progress" tab in project detail with progress bar, milestone checklist (add/tick/delete), and Gantt timeline (diamond markers, Today line); mini progress bar column added to project list table
39. Onboarding checklist — dismissible card at top of dashboard showing 5 steps (create project, invite team member, upload document, add subcontractor, set milestones); completion derived from real DB data via `GET /api/onboarding/status`; progress bar; each incomplete step shows description + CTA link; X dismisses to localStorage; auto-hides when all done
40. DM read receipts — single grey ✓ (sent) / double blue ✓✓ (seen) on outgoing DMs; `?after=` poll response includes `readUpdates [{id, readAt}]` so the sender's tick flips live within 5s without re-fetching the thread
41. Admin beta access UI — "Companies & Beta Access" section on admin dashboard; table lists all companies with plan/status/user count and an orange toggle switch per row; `GET /api/admin/companies` + `PATCH /api/admin/companies/:id/beta-access`, both behind `requireAdmin` email guard; replaces raw SQL workflow
42. Email notifications — `emailNotifications` boolean on users table (default true); Settings > Notifications tab has email toggle backed by `PATCH /api/auth/me`; emails sent via Resend for: new DMs, new channel messages (per-member opt-in), permit expiry at ~7 days and ~1 day (daily server-side interval in `permit-reminders.ts`)
43. QR site board check-in with date-stamped photo — anonymous workers scan QR code, enter name, take photo via device camera; Canvas API stamps name + date/time + project name onto image before upload; GPS captured optionally; `site_checkins` table stores record; Check-ins tab on project detail shows photo grid with worker name and timestamp; `POST /api/site/:token/checkin` (public multipart) + `GET /api/projects/:id/checkins` (auth)
44. QR board pin management — managers pin specific documents, photos, and permits to the site board QR; `qr_board_pins` table (unique per project+type+item, cascade-delete); `GET/POST/DELETE /api/projects/:id/qr-pins`; public `GET /api/site/:token` now resolves and returns `pinnedItems` with full data (doc fileUrl, photo thumbnail, permit status); project detail QR tab shows "Board Contents" panel with thumbtack toggle per item; site-board public page shows "Pinned to this Board" section with View buttons, photo grid, and status badges
45. Subcontractor notes/reminders log — StickyNote button on each sub card opens a "Notes & Reminders" dialog; append-only, timestamped history per subcontractor (date/time + author name); add form gated on `canManageSubcontractors`; Ctrl/Cmd+Enter submits; newest note shown first; `subcontractor_notes` table (id, subcontractorId FK, authorId FK, body, projectId FK nullable, createdAt); `GET/POST /api/subcontractors/:id/notes` (tenant-scoped, IDOR-safe); notes scoped as General (all projects) or project-specific; project Team tab has its own StickyNote button per subcontractor with a General/This-project-only toggle; directory page shows "General" or project-name badge per note
46. Invoice project organisation — invoices linked to a project after marking as paid (popup picker); can be unlinked back to the main list; project detail shows its invoices with viewer and share actions; paid invoices can be reversed to pending; project nav tabs wrap to new lines on mobile instead of scrolling

## Uploads / File Serving

**Critical:** Replit's router only forwards `/api/*` to the Express server. Files must be served under `/api/uploads/` not `/uploads/` or they 404 in the frontend.

- Express serves uploads at **both** `/uploads` (legacy) and `/api/uploads` (`artifacts/api-server/src/app.ts`)
- Upload endpoint (`POST /api/upload`) returns `/api/uploads/<filename>` URLs
- All frontend file links rewrite legacy `/uploads/…` to `/api/uploads/…` before use
- Vite proxy for `/uploads` was also added (`artifacts/sitesort/vite.config.ts`) as a belt-and-braces measure, but the `/api/uploads` path is the reliable one

## Session Log

### 2026-05-22, 2026-05-25 & 2026-05-26 — see CLAUDE_ARCHIVE.md for full detail

## End-of-session notes — 2026-06-09 (compliance documents + certificate attachment)

### Tasks completed today

1. **Subcontractor notes project scoping (feature #45 enhancement)** — committed in-progress Replit Agent work:
   - `subcontractor_notes.projectId` nullable FK added (DB already pushed)
   - API `GET ?projectId=` filter returns general + project-scoped notes together; POST accepts `projectId`
   - Directory page shows "General" or project-name pill badge per note
   - Project Team tab: StickyNote button on each subcontractor member opens a notes dialog with "General (all projects)" / "This project only" scope toggle

2. **Compliance Documents section in project compliance tab** — new section between Permits list and Team Insurance:
   - Shows documents of type `permit`, `safety`, `method_statement` from the project
   - Empty state is a dashed drop zone; clicking opens the upload dialog pre-set to "Permit" type
   - Each doc row: Open button + Share dropdown (Email, WhatsApp, Share with project team) — reuses existing `setSharingDoc` dialog
   - When docs exist, "Upload another document" dashed button at bottom

3. **Certificate attachment on Add Permit dialog** — `FileDropZone` field added (optional):
   - Saves URL to `permits.document_url` column (already existed in DB and API)
   - Permit rows with a certificate show an **Open Certificate** button
   - Email and WhatsApp share now includes the certificate URL in message body
   - "Share with project team" opens team sharing dialog (toast if no cert attached)

4. **Certificate open button on global compliance page** — `expiringPermits` in `GET /api/compliance` now returns `documentUrl`; permit rows show an **Open Certificate** button when a URL is present

### Key files modified
- `lib/db/src/schema/subcontractor_notes.ts` — `projectId` FK
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/subcontractors.ts` — project-scoped notes API
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/compliance.ts` — `documentUrl` added to `expiringPermits`
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/pages/projects/detail.tsx` — notes scope dialog; compliance documents section; cert FileDropZone in Add Permit; Certificate button on permit rows
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/pages/subcontractors/index.tsx` — General/project badge on notes
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/pages/compliance/index.tsx` — Certificate button on permit rows

### Notes for next session
- **Compliance Documents filter**: shows docs of type `permit`, `safety`, `method_statement` only — drawing/general docs remain in the Documents tab
- **`permits.document_url`** column already existed in schema; no DB migration needed for cert attachment
- **Upload dialog pre-set**: opening upload from compliance tab calls `setValue("type", "permit")` before `setIsUploadOpen(true)` — same form as Documents tab
- **API server does NOT hot-reload** — after editing any backend file: `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run build` then restart node process
- **GitHub push command**: `/home/runner/workspace/scripts/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/src/github-push.ts`
- All commits are on `main`

## End-of-session notes — 2026-06-10

### Tasks completed today

1. **QR board pin management (feature #47)** — completed the half-built feature end-to-end:
   - **DB**: `qr_board_pins` table (`id`, `projectId` FK cascade, `itemType`, `itemId`, `pinnedAt`; unique constraint on `projectId+itemType+itemId`); pushed via `drizzle-kit push`
   - **API — management endpoints**: `GET /api/projects/:id/qr-pins`, `POST /api/projects/:id/qr-pins`, `DELETE /api/projects/:id/qr-pins` (body: `{itemType, itemId}`); all authenticated; `onConflictDoNothing` on insert
   - **API — public site board**: `GET /api/site/:token` now batch-fetches pinned docs/photos/permits and returns `pinnedItems` array with full data (document `fileUrl`, photo `photoUrl` + `referenceNumber`, permit computed `status`); URL normalisation via `normaliseUrl()` helper
   - **Frontend — QR tab**: "Board Contents" panel below the QR code; three sections (Documents, Photos, Permits) each with a thumbtack `<Pin>` toggle button (filled orange = pinned); state loaded at component mount alongside other project data; `isPinned()` / `togglePin()` helpers
   - **Frontend — site board public page**: new "Pinned to this Board" card with document rows (View button → `window.open()`), 2-column photo thumbnail grid, permit rows with colour-coded status badge (Active/Expiring Soon/Expired)

### Key files modified
- `lib/db/src/schema/qr_board_pins.ts` — new table
- `lib/db/src/schema/index.ts` — exports `qrBoardPinsTable`
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/qr.ts` — 3 pin endpoints + `pinnedItems` in public site board response
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/pages/projects/detail.tsx` — `Pin` icon import; `qrPins` state; `isPinned`/`togglePin`; Board Contents panel in QR tab; pin fetch added to main `useEffect`
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/pages/site-board.tsx` — `Pin` icon import; `pinnedItems` destructured; "Pinned to this Board" section

### Notes for next session
- **Pin toggle UX**: `<Pin fill="currentColor">` when pinned, `fill="none"` when not; button has `text-primary bg-primary/10` when active
- **`qrBoardPinsTable`** uses `onConflictDoNothing` on insert — safe to call POST twice without error
- **Public site board items**: only pinned items the manager explicitly chose are shown in `pinnedItems`; general permits/docs sections remain unchanged
- **API server does NOT hot-reload** — after editing any backend file: `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run build` then restart node process
- **GitHub push command**: `/home/runner/workspace/scripts/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/src/github-push.ts`
- All commits are on `main`

## End-of-session notes — 2026-06-10 (sign-up flow fixes + drag-and-drop)

### Tasks completed today

1. **Sign-up flow fixes** — three improvements to `artifacts/sitesort/src/pages/auth/register.tsx`:
   - **"Email already registered" on plan change**: when a user goes back from Stripe Checkout to change plan, their JWT is already in localStorage. `onSubmit` now decodes the token, checks `payload.email === data.email`, and if matched skips `registerMutation` entirely — goes straight to a new `/api/billing/checkout` call for the new plan. No duplicate-email error.
   - **Confirm email field**: added `confirmEmail` to Zod schema with `.refine()` match check; field rendered below email input; `confirmEmail` stripped before API call (backend never sees it)
   - **Password visibility toggle**: `Eye`/`EyeOff` icons via new `rightAction` prop on the `Input` component (`artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/input.tsx`); `showPassword` state toggles `type="text"/"password"`

2. **Drag-and-drop file upload fixed globally**:
   - **Dialog backdrop** (`artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`): backdrop is now `pointer-events-none` so it never intercepts drag/drop events; click-to-close moved to outer wrapper with `e.target === e.currentTarget` guard
   - **FileDropZone** (`artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/file-drop-zone.tsx`): added document-level `dragover` + `drop` prevention handlers while mounted — ensures "allow drop" cursor and prevents browser file-navigation anywhere the component is visible
   - **InsuranceCertZone** (`artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/insurance-cert-zone.tsx`): same document-level handlers while `expanded === true`
   - **Upload route multer errors** (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/upload.ts`): wrapped `upload.single()` in a callback so multer rejections (file type, size) return JSON `{error, message}` instead of an HTML error page — frontend now shows the real reason (e.g. "File type not allowed: image/heic") instead of generic "Upload failed"

3. **Database cleanup** — deleted 4 automated test accounts (`@test.com`) from the companies/users tables

### Key files modified
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/pages/auth/register.tsx` — plan-change token reuse, confirm email, password eye icon
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/input.tsx` — `rightAction` prop
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` — `pointer-events-none` backdrop
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/file-drop-zone.tsx` — document-level drag handlers
- `artifacts/sitesort/src/components/ui/insurance-cert-zone.tsx` — document-level drag handlers
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/upload.ts` — multer JSON error handling

### Notes for next session
- **API server rebuild**: after any backend change run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run build`, then start with `PORT=8080 node artifacts/api-server/dist/index.mjs`
- **API server dist**: outputs to `artifacts/api-server/dist/index.mjs` (ESM, not CJS)
- **Replit auto-manages the server** — don't kill/restart manually unless necessary
- **GitHub push command**: `/home/runner/workspace/scripts/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/src/github-push.ts`
- **Remaining test accounts in DB**: Acme Construction (demo), Beta Builds (bob@betabuilds.com), Test SiteSort (amy-parrish@hotmail.co.uk), Test SiteSort 2 (dean.parrish@me.com)
- All commits are on `main`
