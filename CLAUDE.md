# SiteSort – Claude Code Guide

## Project

SiteSort is a full-stack construction site information management platform for SME construction companies. Built as a pnpm monorepo with TypeScript throughout.

## Stack

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces
- **API**: Express 5, Node 24, TypeScript 5.9
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod (v4), drizzle-zod
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite, React Query, react-hook-form, Recharts
- **Build**: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Repo Structure

```
artifacts/
  api-server/       # Express API (port 8080, served at /api)
  sitesort/         # React + Vite frontend (port 18299, served at /)
lib/
  api-spec/         # OpenAPI spec + Orval codegen config
  api-client-react/ # Generated React Query hooks
  api-zod/          # Generated Zod schemas
  db/               # Drizzle ORM schema + DB connection
scripts/
  src/
    github-setup.ts # Creates the GitHub repo via Replit Connectors
    github-push.ts  # Pushes workspace files to GitHub via GitHub API
```

## Key Commands

```bash
pnpm run typecheck                              # Typecheck from root
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen  # Regenerate API client + Zod schemas
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push           # Push DB schema changes
```

## Pushing to GitHub

There is no git remote pointing to GitHub. Pushes are done via the Replit Connectors SDK:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/src/github-push.ts
```

This uses the authenticated GitHub connector (no token needed) to push all workspace files to `deanparrish-cmd/sitesort` via the GitHub Contents API.

To create the repo fresh:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/src/github-setup.ts
```

## Auth

JWT tokens, stored as `sitesort_token` in localStorage. Header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Demo credentials: `paul@acme.com` / `password123` (company: Acme Construction)

## Features Built

1. Version-controlled document hub (auto versioning, SUPERSEDED badges)
2. Targeted team distribution (track pending/viewed/acknowledged)
3. Digital sign-off tracking (PIN confirmation, timestamped)
4. Real-time in-app notifications
5. Compliance photo log (timestamped, GPS metadata, reference numbers)
6. Subcontractor insurance monitor (valid/expiring_soon/expired)
7. QR code site board integration
8. Permit management (active/expiring/expired, responsible persons)
9. Compliance center (aggregate view across projects)
10. Team management (admin/project_manager/site_worker/subcontractor roles)

## Session Log

### 2026-03-26
- Built and completed all 10 core features of the SiteSort platform
- Added `scripts/src/github-setup.ts` to create the GitHub repo via Replit Connectors SDK
- Added `scripts/src/github-push.ts` to push workspace files to GitHub via the GitHub Contents API (owner: `deanparrish-cmd`, repo: `sitesort`)
- Confirmed GitHub push mechanism works without a personal access token (uses Replit OAuth connector)
